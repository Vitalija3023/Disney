            <p>There have also been several Disney heroes and heroines who serve as secondary characters, whether they are princely suitors, fairy godmothers, animal sidekicks, etc. While these types of characters aren't to be dismissed, they usually take a backseat to some of the most popular and universally recognizable classic Disney heroes.</p>

                     <p>Since the character of <span class="font-italik" >Robin Hood </span> was not created by Disney, it's easy to overlook his heroic acts in the 1973 animated film. Similar to the source material, this <span class="font-italik" >Robin Hood</span> remains the selfless hero of people, who dedicated his life to ensuring the poor were provided for.</p>
                     <p>Although  <span class="font-italik" >Robin</span> is a wanted fugitive, the fox continuously puts his life on the line to protect the residents of Nottingham from Prince John's tyrannical reign. Not only does he lead an intense battle and defeats Prince John's soldiers but he also rescues his friend, Friar Tuck, from execution. Robin continues his heroics by saving Tagalong and defeating the Sheriff of Nottingham in a duel</p>
